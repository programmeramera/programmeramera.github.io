Being a good developer naturally requires lots of technical skills in software engineering, solution architecture and the ability to both read and write several programming languages. But is it enough?

When I introduce programming to some students I also take the opportunity to discuss some of the more personal skills and capabilities of a good developer. Please bear in mind that these are my personal preferences and I would really like to get some feedback on them:

+ Linguist - strong skills in english
I guess this comes as no secret but most of the content available, including search results, blogs, questions on stackoverflow is written in english. And don't forget that most programming languages are using english words as syntax.

+ Calculus - at least a basic understanding of maths
This should probably not be surprising to anyone reading that maths is an important skill in programming, understanding vectors, algebra and geometry. I still think though that the only time I really leverage all of the more complex math skills I have learned in school is when doing programming, and in particular game development.

+ Curios - enjoy solving problems, quizzes, riddles, pattern matching
The essence of programming is in my opinion the skill of taking a large complex problem and dividing it up into pieces that is more easily solvable. This process goes on recursively until you are so low in instructions that you can represent it with a keyword in the programming language.

I take greay joy in playing computer games, solving riddles, math problems and quizzes, and I often find myself learning something as I do this, either a method of solving the problem or maybe some facts that I wasn't aware of.

+ Courage - don't be afraid to fail
This is something that I find very important, especially when talking to young aspiring developers. There's no chance whatsoever that you will get everything right from the beginning, you will fail, fast, often and probably severe as well. But the key here is to learn by your mistakes and also educate others that might be in the same situation.

There are so many cool quotes that can be leveraged for this: 

"Do or do not, there is no try" - Yoda
"A black belt is a white belt that never gave up" - Unknown
"You learn more from failure than from success. Don't let it stop you! Failure builds character." - Unknown
"Whether you think you can or think you can't, you're right!" - Henry Ford

Another aspect of being courageous is to be able to expose your vulnerabilities. No one is expecting you to know everything, but there are expectations of progress, meaning you should not hesitate to ask for guidance or help when stuck with a problem you simply can't fix yourself. On the other side, be aware that other people might be busy with other tasks and it's usually not up to you to decide if your tasks are more important that theirs. This means you shouldn't disturb people too often and respect that they might have to prioritize themselves. Also, you will rarely be alone in a project and hence others will read what you just wrote (actually you should write so that others can read) and most likely relate and react to the code in question. They will comment, fix, change and maybe even delete, just remember that it's part of the process, and you will do the same, and you should!

+ Googler - know your way around the internet
Once again, you simply can't be expected to know it all, but you should know where to turn for guidance and assistance. The internet is a huge source of knowledge and knowing where and how to search is key. I honestly have found myself stuck with a problem and searched the internet, finding the answer on my own blog, that was an interesting experience I tell you. 

This also means that you should know how to search before you post, there is a huge possibility that someone else have had the same issue as you earlier and that the question has already been asked, don't waste others time in having to respond once more on the same topic, instead learn the search language of the forum in question and try a couple of times to find the solution before posting a new question.

+ Samaritan - willing to help others
Asking for help is one thing, being open and available to others is another. Be aware that when your expertise growths, so does the interest and amount of requests for guidance from others. Be respectful, keep in mind that you where once in their shoes, asking for help, not knowing everything there is to know about the topic you finally mastered. The developer community has grown into a sometimes hostile environment with people being disrespectful and arrogant towards newcomers, don't be like that! A great advice was given to me once saying that the thing you write to someone on the internet, in social media or wherever, you should be able to tell someone if they where in the same room as you, to their face. Try to keep that in mind.

+ Disciplined - get and keep focused
Are you a morning person or an evening person, when do you perform the best? That is interesting however, if the working hours of your employment is between 09.00 and 17.00 that's when you are expected to perform. Learn how to get rid of stuff that bothers you, learn how to prioritize your tasks and spend time on what's most important currently. If you enjoy listening to music, please do, but don't expect others to like overhearing Marilyn Manson growling from your headphones. There are several methods that helps you keep your focus, monotasking, pomodoro, lists of tasks or simply keeping one computer screen on your desk, evaluate and contemplate. What works for you?

I consider myself very good at distancing me from personal or outside issues when doing work, but then again, I am apparently quite good at distancing myself from uninteresting stuff at home as well such as laundry, dishes or cleaning, good or bad, not very good at least!

+ Insightful - be able to handle stress and pressure
Focus is important, but there will come several times when the deadline is closing in and you feel the expectations on your results growing. Then you need to be even more insightful in prioritizing and keeping your focus on the most important tasks at hand. I have learned that I myself perform probably my best when being pressured with a deadline but occassionally loose focus completely when being stressed with several simultanous tasks.

+ Binary thinking - be able to think as a computer
Computers are actually really stupid, they simply do exactly what we tell them to. If you understand this and also knows how computers process instructions, parse them and executes them you will better structure both your code and your tasks at hand.
