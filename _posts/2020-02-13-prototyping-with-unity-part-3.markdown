Now I've managed to get a simple texture to give the tower a bit more juice, not really satisfied with either the graphics nor how I solved the atlas use for all the different parts of the tower, but it works sufficient. I also took some time to model a builder, it doesn't really fit into the greek concept, but it will have to due, since there are some other stuff I want to investigate:

+ The game board must come alive
+ A skybox
+ Potentially an AI-player, or at least a random counterpart
