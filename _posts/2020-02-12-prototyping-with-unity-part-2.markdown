Here is an update of the small Santorini-protoype. I've had a couple of fun evenings trying to understand Blender to be able create the models that at least look like the ones in the box.

Some of the next steps:
+ Textures
+ Proper models for the builders
+ The game board has to come alive
+ A nice skybox
