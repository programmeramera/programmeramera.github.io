In an effort to learn more about Typescript which is a programming language superset of Javascript, I've spent a couple of hours in translating [Tess Ferrandez XNA implementation]. 

I've used the framework [Phaser] which is really nice and something I intend to continue using. It's a relatively simple framework with lots of features, and also a growing community which is appreciated. There's a lot of information and documentation which helps educate myself.

It's been great fun, even though I'm not entirely comfortable in the language and framework yet. But I will absolutely continue with both Typescript and Phaser and see where the road leads.
