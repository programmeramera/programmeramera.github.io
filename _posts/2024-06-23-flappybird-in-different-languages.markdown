A game that I've been impressed by is Flappy Bird. Not because it's technically advanced or graphically inspiring, instead in it's simplicity it very fun and slightly addictive. Thanks to the limited functionality it has been a game I've leveraged to learn different programming languages.

So far I've only built the game in [C#], [C++] and [Rust], but there might be a couple more in the future.

Below you can play the [C++] version compiled with [Emscripten] to Web Assembly.
